# Application Web Design

## Introduction and academic background
- I'm Luis Lezama
- I'm 20 years old
- I'm at the 6th semester (of 8) of Software Development Engineering (IDS) major at Universidad Tecmilenio
- I'm in an internship as a QA Tester in one of Grupo Carso's digital projects.

### My interests in programming, design or engineering
Since I was 8 years old I loved software and technology in general, I've installed my first Linux distro when I was 10 ðŸ˜‚ When I was 12 years old I began learning web development with, of course, HTML and JavaScript, and began learning PHP when I was 14. Currently, I master those programming languages, and I've worked and created great projects with some others such as Python, Java, Kotlin, Swift, C++ and C#.\
Additionally, I began learning and practicing graphic design as a hobby, because I wanted to create beautiful UIs for my developments. I think this is something I'm really good at, and plan to take professional courses after earning my IDS degree. I love to think of fake brands and designing its corporate identity, playing with color palettes and different typographies.\
Everything I know I have learned self-taught on a lot of different websites.

    - Take professional courses of digital graphic design

## Relevant personal projects
Right now, only one of my best projects has its own GitHub repo: [Gunther](https://github.com/Luisito3107/Gunther). It's a Discord bot created with Node.js to play music in the voice channels. I haven't updated it since 2022, but it's because I've already added everything my friends and I needed for our server. Maybe I'll update it to remove some stuff that no longer works (because of Discord updates).\
With the boom of ChatGPT, last year I created a Telegram bot that serves as a client of the Chat Completion API of OpenAI, allowing to have GPT 3.5 conversations from Telegram. I'll upload it to GitHub soon.\
Also in 2022, I created an Android app and a Python server that records device sensor data to create CSV datasets of different physical actions, in order to train a model to predict those actions. I got COVID that year and didn't continued the development, but this semester I may resume it for my Big Data certificate course.
